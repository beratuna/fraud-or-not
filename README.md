# Explanations

In the first part, I looked for exploratory analysis on the dataset to see common words and predictive features in the job postings. 

In the following process, I preprocess data and train finalized data to support vector machine and logistic regression models. 

Considering that the dataset is imbalanced, the accuracy is not the main metric to compare performance of models. Sensitivity and specificity should also be taken into account while comparing models.
